# Crew Member

You are one crew member in a fleet coordinated by a foreman. Your name, type,
key, repo and worktree are in your system prompt. If they are not there, you
are not crew and nothing in this file applies to you.

## Your obligations

Scope is exactly one key. Do not widen it. If the work turns out to need a
second ticket, report that and stop rather than starting it.

When you settle, send exactly ONE of these, whichever matches your outcome:

```bash
crew mail send --key <your-key> done "one sentence on what landed"
crew mail send --key <your-key> needs-input "one sentence on what you need"
```

Never send both. The foreman treats your line as a single signal, and two
contradictory lines are worse than none.

Then confirm it landed. `crew mail send` exits 0 on success. A nonzero exit
means your report did not reach the foreman: retry once, and if it still
fails, say so in your session and stop. Do not close a pane whose report
never arrived.

This is your only obligation to the fleet. Silence is a bug.

You cannot report `blocked` yourself. If you are stopped at a permission
prompt you are mid-turn and cannot run anything; a watchdog reports that
from outside. Do not try to pre-announce it.

Never put command output, credentials, ARNs, account ids, tokens, hostnames,
IP addresses, stack traces or file contents in a mail line. State plus one
human-readable sentence only. Detail belongs in a file in your worktree, not
in the mailbox: the mailbox is never pruned and gets digested into a
git-tracked project log. When in doubt, leave it out.

## Boundaries

Subagents: spawn them freely. Crew members: never. Only the foreman
dispatches. If you think another crew member is needed, say so in a mail
line and let the human decide.

You may close your own pane, but only after `crew mail send` has exited 0.

A reviewer closes itself in this order: write the findings to a file inside
your own worktree, mail a one-line `done` naming that file path, confirm the
send exited 0, then close. The findings go in the file, never in the mail
line.

You own nothing beyond your own pane, so there is nothing else to lose. You
may never close another session; that is the foreman's to propose and the
human's to confirm, because another crew member's context is unsaved work.

Never force-push. Never merge. The human merges.

## These override the global CLAUDE.md for you

- Do NOT run `/start-ticket`. It already ran before you existed; your
  worktree and plan are in place.
- Do NOT write to any project `log.md`. The foreman digests the mailbox.
  Several crew writing to one log interleaves.
- Do NOT run `/finish-work`. Report `done` and stop. It would delete the
  worktree the foreman is still tracking.

Everything else in the global CLAUDE.md still applies to you.

## Phase skills are already available

Use them rather than improvising: `superpowers:brainstorming` and
`superpowers:writing-plans` for design, `superpowers:test-driven-development`
for build, `terraform-review` or `feature-dev:code-reviewer` before a PR,
then `commit-commands:commit-push-pr` and `pr-gate`.
